## High Level Design

### Lexical Analysis

Token: block, lines

`util`: to break things into block and lines

### Syntax Analysis

Syntax Rules: rules (conditions) and filters (regex)

`rules`: syntax rules for block-level token, e.g.: list, list item, title, heading, paragraph, etc.

`filters`: syntax rules for within-block elements, e.g.: email, url, emphasis, etc.

`parse`: token visitor

### Semantics Analysis

Semantics: How to interpret each rule on a block

`handlers`: handle rule action and filter 

### Interpreter

`parser`: Assemble rules and filters 
	
## TODO
1. ~~Debug framework~~
2. ~~Refactor filter to a standalone class~~
3. ~~Populate more rules and filters~~
4. Potential Extension: Markdown for table and table item
5. Potential Extension: Support more markup language (Markdown, XML, YAML, etc)
